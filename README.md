## Project Overview
The project consists of the following components:
1. **NS2 Simulation (Tcl Script):** Simulates a MANET environment with configurable parameters such as the number of nodes, routing protocols, and source-destination pairs. The simulation generates trace files (.tr) and network animation files (.nam) for performance analysis.<br><br>
2. **Python GUI for Proactive Routing (OLSR):** A Python script that simulates proactive routing using Tkinter for the GUI. It allows users to visualize node movement, routing table updates, and packet transmission.<br><br>
3. **Python GUI for Reactive Routing (AODV):** A Python script that simulates reactive routing using Tkinter for the GUI. It demonstrates on-demand route discovery and packet transmission.<br><br>
4. **Performance Analysis Scripts:**
    - **graph.py:** A Python script that reads performance metrics from performance.txt and generates a bar chart to visualize the results.
    - **performance.awk:** An AWK script that processes the trace files generated by NS2 to calculate performance metrics such as throughput, PDR, delay, packet loss, and overhead.
    - **performance.txt:** A text file that stores the calculated performance metrics after running the NS2 simulation.

## Features
**NS2 Simulation (Tcl Script)**
- Configurable Parameters: Users can specify the number of nodes, routing protocol (AODV or OLSR), and source-destination pairs.
- Dynamic Node Movement: Nodes move randomly within the simulation area, and the network topology updates in real-time.
- Trace and Animation Files: The simulation generates .tr (trace) and .nam (animation) files for performance analysis and visualization.

**Python GUI for Proactive Routing (OLSR)**
- Continuous Route Updates: Nodes periodically update their routing tables to maintain up-to-date route information.
- Interactive GUI: Users can start/stop node movement, send data packets, and view routing tables.
- Dynamic Node Movement: Nodes move randomly within the simulation area, and the network topology updates in real-time.
- Routing Table Visualization: Users can view the routing tables of all nodes, showing the next hop and hop count for each destination.

**Python GUI for Reactive Routing (AODV)**
- On-Demand Route Discovery: Routes are discovered only when needed, reducing overhead in highly dynamic networks.
- Interactive GUI: Users can start/stop node movement, send data packets, and observe the route discovery process.
- Dynamic Node Movement: Nodes move randomly, and the network topology updates in real-time.
- Route Discovery Visualization: Users can observe the Route Request (RREQ) and Route Reply (RREP) process as nodes discover routes.

**Performance Analysis Scripts**
- graph.py: Generates a bar chart to visualize performance metrics such as throughput, PDR, delay, packet loss, and overhead.
- performance.awk: Processes the trace files generated by NS2 to calculate performance metrics.
- performance.txt: Stores the calculated performance metrics for further analysis.

## Run the NS2 simulation
Navigate to the directory containing the Tcl script:
```
cd ns2-simulation
```
Run the simulation using the following command:
```
ns sim.tcl <Number of Nodes> <Routing Protocol> <Source Node> <Destination Node> <Second Source Node> <Second Destination Node>
```
Example:
```
ns sim.tcl 10 AODV 1 5 2 6
```
To view the simulation animation, use the nam command (nam nameOfTheProtocol_numOfNodes.nam):
```
nam AODV_10.nam
```

---

## Run the Python GUI for Proactive Routing (OLSR):
Navigate to the Python GUI directory:
```
cd python-gui-proactive
```
Run the Python script:
```
python proactive_routing.py
```
OR 
```
python3 proactive_routing.py
```

---

## Run the Python GUI for Reactive Routing (AODV):
Navigate to the Python GUI directory:
```
cd python-gui-reactive
```
Run the Python script:
```
python reactive_routing.py
```
OR 
```
python3 reactive_routing.py
```

---

## Analyze Performance Metrics:
After running the NS2 simulation, the performance.awk script will generate performance.txt with the calculated metrics.
#### Run the 'performance.awk' script
To analyze the performance metrics from your NS2 simulation, run the `performance.awk` script on the trace file generated by NS2 (e.g., `AODV_10.tr`). <br>Use the following command:
```
awk -f performance.awk AODV_10.tr > performance.txt
```
Now the calculated metrics (e.g. throughput, PDR, delay, packet loss, and overhead) is saved into performance.txt.
#### Run the graph.py script to visualize
After generating performance.txt, you can visualize the performance metrics by running the graph.py script. <br>Use the following command:
```
python graph.py
```
OR
```
python3 graph.py
```
This script reads the metrics from performance.txt and generates a bar chart to visualize the results.

## Routing Protocols
### Proactive Routing (OLSR)
**Definition:** Proactive routing protocols continuously update routing tables to maintain up-to-date route information.
##### Advantages:
- Immediate route availability for data transmission.
- No route discovery delay during data transfer.
- Well-suited for low-mobility environments.

##### Disadvantages:
- High overhead due to frequent route updates.
- Not suitable for highly dynamic networks.

### Reactive Routing (AODV)
**Definition:** Reactive routing protocols discover routes only when needed, on-demand.
##### Advantages:
- Lower overhead compared to proactive protocols.
- Ideal for networks with high mobility or unpredictable topology.
- Efficient in terms of bandwidth usage.

##### Disadvantages:
- Higher latency for route discovery during data transmission.
- Route discovery process can fail if no route exists.
- May lead to longer delays in real-time applications.

## Performance Metrics
The following performance metrics are calculated and visualized:
<br>**Throughput:** The rate at which data is successfully transferred from one point to another in the network.<br>
<br>**Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR):** The ratio of successfully received packets to the total packets sent.<br>
<br>**Average Delay:** The average time it takes for a packet to travel from the sender to the receiver.<br>
<br>**Packet Loss:** The percentage of packets that are sent but never reach the destination.<br>
<br>**Overhead:** The extra resources consumed by the routing protocol beyond the actual data transmission.

## Performance Analysis
The performance.awk script processes the trace files generated by the NS2 simulation to calculate the following metrics:
<br>**Throughput (kbps):** The rate of successful data transfer.<br>
<br>**PDR (%):** The percentage of packets successfully delivered.<br>
<br>**Average Delay (s):** The average time taken for packets to reach the destination.<br>
<br>**Packet Loss (%):** The percentage of packets lost during transmission.<br>
<br>**Overhead (%):** The additional resources consumed by the routing protocol.<br>
<br>The graph.py script reads the calculated metrics from performance.txt and generates a bar chart to visualize the results.
